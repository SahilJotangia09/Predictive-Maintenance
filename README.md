# Predictive Analysis for Manufacturing Operations

## Overview
This project implements a RESTful API for predictive analysis in manufacturing operations. The API predicts machine downtime based on manufacturing data using a supervised machine learning model. It includes endpoints to upload data, train the model, and make predictions.

---

## Features
- Upload a CSV file containing manufacturing data.
- Train a machine learning model on the uploaded data.
- Make predictions on machine downtime based on input parameters.
- Supports batch and single predictions.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`):
  - FastAPI or Flask (API framework)
  - scikit-learn (for machine learning model)
  - pandas (for data handling)
  - numpy (for numerical computations)
